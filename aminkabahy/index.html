     <p>Are you looking for solutions to exercises and problems in <i> Introduction to Algorithms?</i></p>
     <p>If you are, then see the <a href=""> frequently asked question and answer</a> below.</p>
     <p>If you request solutions from me, I will not respond.</p>

     <p>From July 2004 through June 2008, I was the director of the Dartmouth Institute for Writing and Rhetoric.</p>
     <p>I occasionally taught a graduate Computer Science course on how to write papers and how to give talks. I publish a list of usage rules that I required my students to observe.</p>

     <p>In 2015, PRI's "The World" ran a story on mentoring women in computer science in which a couple of my students and I were interviewed.</p>
     <hr>
     <p>I was interviewed for the Command Line Heroes podcast "Learning the BASICs."<br>
        You can also hear me spout off in "Philosophical Trials #7."<br>
        I talked about writing Introduction to Algorithms in an episode of "Frank Stajano Explains."<br>
        And an interview with a Brazilian vlogger.</p>

            <h5>Introduction to Algorithms</h5>
            <p>Yes, I am coauthor of Introduction to Algorithms, along with Charles Leiserson, Ron Rivest, and Cliff Stein. For MIT Press's 50th anniversary, I wrote a post on their blog about the secret to writing a best-selling textbook.</p>
            <p>Here are answers to a few frequently asked questions about Introduction to Algorithms:</p>
            <p>Will there be a fourth edition? If so, when will it be available?<br>
                The fourth edition was released on 5 April 2022. The MIT Press site for the book has links to sites that sell it .</p>
                <p>Where can I find a list of errata?<br>
                    For the fourth edition, we maintain an errata page that allows you to list errors by date, by page, or by severity.</p>
                    <p>For the second and third editions, we maintained an errata page that allows you to list errors by date, by page, by severity, or by discoverer <br> There is even an incremental update feature <br> allowing you to list only the errors posted since the last date that you asked about <br> We stopped logging errors for the third edition in January 2019 so that we could focus on preparing the fourth edition.</p>
                    <p>How do I report errors?<br>
                        First, please visit the errata page to verify that the error has not been reported already Once you have determined that you have found an unreported <br> error, send email to clrs-bugs@mit.edu. We will respond as quickly as possible, often within a day.</p>
                        <p>Please use the clrs-bugs@mit.edu address only to report errors. If you have a suggestion or a question, please contact me directly <br> at thc@cs.dartmouth.edu.</p>
                        <p>Do you correct errors? <br>
                            Yes. Each time a new printing is produced, it contains corrections to all errors that have been reported by that time. The errata page indicates in <br> which printing each error was corrected.</p>
                            <p>What is the difference between an edition and a printing? <br>
                                Each edition is a major revision of the book. The first edition of Introduction to Algorithms was published in 1990, the second edition came out  in <br> 2001, the third edition appeared in 2009, and the fourth edition is from 2022. A printing for a given edition occurs when the publisher needs to <br> manufacture more copies. As the answer to the previous question indicates, we have been correcting errors in each printing of the second and third <br> editions. We perturb the pagination as little as possible when correcting errors for a new printing.</p>
                                <p>Can I get solutions to exercises and problems? <br>
                                    As of the third edition, we are making available solutions for a select set of exercises and problems. They are posted at the MIT Press website.</p>
                                    <p>We have also produced an Instructor's Manual, which is available only to instructors who have adopted the book for course use. The manual has <br> lecture notes and solutions to additional exercises and problems, but by no means all of them. (I estimate that writing up solutions to all exercises <br> and problems would take somewhere between 2000 and 3000 pages.) You'll need to contact the MIT Press for passwords to access the manual site <br> and the files. (Contact information is at the MIT Press website.) You cannot get the passwords from me or from any of my coauthors.</p>
